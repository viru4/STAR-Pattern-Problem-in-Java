#STAR Pattern Problem in Java
This repository provides a collection of Java methods for printing various star (*) patterns to the console. Each method in Pattern.java generates a different pattern, making it a useful resource for learning nested loops, conditionals, and console output formatting in Java.

Available Star Pattern Methods
The following patterns are implemented in Pattern.java:

pattern1(int n): Left-aligned triangle
pattern2(int n): Inverted left-aligned triangle
pattern3(int n): Right-aligned triangle
pattern4(int n): Hollow square
pattern5(int n): Left-aligned triangle with spaces
pattern6(int n): Hollow square (duplicate of pattern4)
pattern7(int n): Square with diagonals and border
pattern8(int n): Hollow square with top alignment
pattern9(int n): Square with left indentation
pattern10(int n): Hollow square with left indentation
pattern11(int n): Lower triangle with left border
pattern12(int n): Left triangle with hollow
pattern13(int n): Right triangle with hollow
pattern14(int n): Pyramid
pattern15(int n): Hollow pyramid
pattern16(int n): Inverted hollow pyramid
pattern17(int n): Diamond (filled)
pattern18(int n): Diamond (filled, centered)
pattern19(int n): Double triangle (hourglass)
pattern20(int n): Double triangle (diamond)
pattern21(int n): Plus sign pattern
pattern22(int n): X sign pattern
pattern23(int n): Box with hollow and border
How to Run
Clone the repository:
Code
git clone https://github.com/viru4/STAR-Pattern-Problem-in-Java.git
Open the project in your Java IDE or use the terminal.
Edit the main method in Pattern.java to call the pattern method you want to view. For example:
Java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    pattern1(5); // Replace with any pattern method and size
}
Compile and run:
Code
javac Pattern.java
java Pattern
Feel free to experiment by changing the method and the value of n to see different patterns!
